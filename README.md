My Portfolio Website
This is a responsive portfolio website that showcases my work and skills as a web developer. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a modern design with a clean and intuitive layout. It includes a home page, an about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page, all of which are fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes and devices.

The website features smooth scrolling and interactive animations, which add an engaging and dynamic touch to the user experience. It also includes a contact form that allows potential clients to get in touch with me easily and quickly.

In building this website, I focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly platform that highlights my portfolio pieces and demonstrates my technical skills. I used various web development tools and frameworks, such as Bootstrap and jQuery, to achieve a professional and polished look.

Feel free to explore my website and get in touch if you have any questions or inquiries.
